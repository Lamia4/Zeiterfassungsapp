Build up the example described on the csurf-project's homepage.

1. Demonstrate that the double CSRF (`{cookie: true}`) works.
2. Show an attack without the CSRF-token
3. Show an attack with the CSRF-token (somehow stolen)
   The malicious form must be delivered from another address (e.g. 192.168.x.y)
    - Why does this attack work?
    - What to do against it?
